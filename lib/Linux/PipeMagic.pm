=head1 NAME

Linux::PipeMagic - Perl extension to use the zero copy IO syscalls

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Linux::PipeMagic qw/ systee syssplice syssendfile /;
  systee($fh_in, $fh_out, $num_bytes, 0);
  syssplice($fh_in, $fh_out, $num_bytes, 0);
  syssendfile($fh_out, $fh_in, $num_bytes);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Linux::PipeMagic is a Perl XS wrapper around the L<splice(2)>, L<tee(2)> and L<sendfile(2)>
syscalls.  You can use them to efficiently copy data from one file descriptor to
another inside the kernel (splice), or to efficiently copy data from one pipe
to another (tee).

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over

=item sysplice($fh_in, $fh_out, $num_bytes, $flags)

Copies C<$num_bytes> from C<$fh_in> to C<$fh_out>.  This is roughly equivalent to,

    sysread($fh_in, my $buf, $num_bytes);
    syswrite($fh_out, $buf);

although the transfer takes place entirely in kernel space.

Returns the number of bytes transferred.

=item systee($fh_in, $fh_out, $num_bytes, $flags)

Copies C<$num_bytes> from C<$fh_in> to C<$fh_out>.  The filehandles must both
be of type pipe.  This works similarly like C<syssplice> but does not advance the
read pointer in C<$fh_in>.

Returns the number of bytes transferred.

=item syssendfile($fh_out, $fh_in, $num_bytes)

Copies C<$num_bytes> from C<$fh_in> to C<$fh_out>.  With current versions of
Linux, C<$fh_in> must be a file opened for reading, and C<$fh_out> must be a
writable socket.  Note the different order of parameters compared to the other
functions.
